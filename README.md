# About specifications and game system  
Call of cthulhu 7e system created by Sandy Petersen in 1981 and revised by Mike Mason and Paul Fricker for the 7th edition released in 2015. Japanese version translated and released in Japan in 2020.
Call of Cthulhu is a horror-themed roleplaying game based  on  the  writings  of  Howard  Phillips  Lovecraft.  Lovecraft penned a tremendous body of work during the 1920s and 1930s, concerning both horrors from beyond and from within. Lovecraft’s most famous invention has become known as the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of stories sharing common plot elements such as certain mythical books  of  arcane  lore  and  alien  god-like  entities.  If  you  have not read any of his stories it is strongly recommend you do so. (Quote from quickstart guide)

This system does not offer advanced automation, but assumes that you will copy/paste the contents of the template compendium located under the Character Sheet Template compendium.
This is because Japan uses different kinds of supplements which change skill names and rules, thus this sheet was created for Japan audience use primarily, but feel free to use this english version if you please.

Combat is tracked through order of DEX attribute. There's a vehicle sheet template aswell for your chasing needs.
A DiceBot system is implemented in this system. If a skill value is entered after the command "/cc",  
the system judges success or failure.  
The "/cc-2" to "/cc2" bonus and penalty dice are now possible.  
And the combination command "/CBR" appeared.  
Enter a skill value as "/CBR skill value, skill value" to see the combination.  
# Author's Boring Thoughts  
Playing Call of Cthulhu is a horrible game that asks for immorality and commits blasphemy.  
However, I like this game very much.  
It's important for everyone to enjoy playing the game.
